The urgency to address climate change has led to innovative policy interventions across the globe. In the United States, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) stands as a prime example of a collaborative, state-led effort to reduce carbon emissions. This report evaluates the RGGI's effectiveness by analyzing the differences in CO2 generation emissions between states participating in the RGGI and those not participating as of 2019. 

Our causal analysis hinged on a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model with fixed effects, which capitalized on the natural experiment provided by the varying adoption times of RGGI across states. Using data on generation emissions, energy production sources, and electricity retail prices, we controlled for confounding variables like energy production profiles and weather dynamics. Our model controlled for state and time-fixed effects, thereby adjusting for potential unobserved heterogeneity and time-varying factors that might influence emissions. 

The analysis yielded a statistically significant negative coefficient for the interaction term between RGGI treatment and the post-treatment period, indicating that RGGI implementation is associated with a reduction in CO2 generation emissions. Specifically, the implementation of RGGI is associated with a 24.2% reduction in CO2 emissions on average, compared to states not participating in RGGI over the same study period. This key finding substantiates the efficacy of the RGGI program in lowering emissions among participating states. While this general result is compelling, it is important to note that our Difference-in-Differences analysis focusing on one treated state with multiple control states did not yield conclusive results. However, when examining all treated states as a group, the regression outcomes were significant and indicative of RGGI's effectiveness. The different coal, natural gas and oil mix was also found to be a significant determinant of emissions levels, emphasizing the link between the energy source and CO2 output. Importantly, the analysis also revealed that higher Cooling Degree Days (CDD), which reflect increased temperatures requiring more air conditioning, are associated with increased emissions. This underscores the challenge of rising temperatures and their impact on energy consumption and emissions, reinforcing the need for comprehensive strategies that address both emissions trading and energy efficiency under varying climatic conditions. 

The report's conclusions offer crucial insights into the policy's success and underscore the potential of cap-and-trade programs to mitigate climate change impacts. By demonstrating RGGI's positive environmental outcomes, this study lends support to the continued use and potential expansion of market-based regulatory approaches to environmental challenges. 

Our findings are intended to inform policymakers, stakeholders, and the public about the benefits of cooperative regional efforts like RGGI and their vital role in the broader context of sustainable energy policy and climate change mitigation.
